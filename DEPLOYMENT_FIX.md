# üöÄ Deployment Fix for Image Upload 405 Error

## Problem
Getting "Upload failed with status 405" error in production because serverless platforms like Vercel don't support writing to the local file system.

## Solution
I've updated the code to automatically detect serverless environments and use cloud storage fallback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Add Environment Variables
In your Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

```bash
STORAGE_PROVIDER=base64
MAX_FILE_SIZE=20971520
```

### 2. Deploy Updated Code
The upload route now automatically detects if it's running on Vercel and uses cloud storage instead of local file system.

### 3. Test Upload
After deployment, try uploading an image again. It should now work!

## üîß What Changed

### Files Modified:
- `app/api/upload/images/route.ts` - Added serverless detection and cloud storage fallback
- `lib/cloud-storage.ts` - Improved fallback logic for serverless environments
- `vercel.json` - Added to configure API route timeouts
- `.env.example` - Updated with storage configuration

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Detection**: Code detects if running on Vercel/serverless
- **Smart Fallback**: Uses base64 storage for small images in emergencies
- **Local Development**: Still works normally in development
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages for debugging

## üåü Recommended: Setup Cloudinary (Optional)

For better image handling in production, setup Cloudinary:

1. **Create Cloudinary Account**: Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)

2. **Get API Keys**: From your dashboard, copy:
   - Cloud Name
   - API Key  
   - API Secret

3. **Add to Vercel Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   STORAGE_PROVIDER=cloudinary
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

- **Base64**: Works immediately but increases database size
- **Cloudinary**: Better performance, CDN, but requires setup
- **Local**: Only works in development

## üö® Important

1. **Deploy these changes** to Vercel
2. **Add environment variables** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Test upload functionality** after deployment

The 405 error should now be resolved! üéâ
