# 🔧 Shiprocket Integration Fixes Applied

## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

Your orders were not appearing in Shiprocket due to **two configuration issues** that have now been resolved.

---

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Mock Delivery Mode Disabled**
- **Problem**: `FORCE_MOCK_DELIVERY=true` was preventing real Shiprocket API calls
- **Fix**: Changed to `FORCE_MOCK_DELIVERY=false` in `.env`
- **Impact**: Orders now use real Shiprocket API instead of mock responses

### **2. Pickup Location Configuration Updated**
- **Problem**: Configured pickup location (ID: 10304720) was **INACTIVE**
- **Fix**: Updated to use active pickup location (ID: 9924650)
- **Details**:
  ```
  OLD: SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_LOCATION_ID=10304720 (INACTIVE)
  NEW: SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_LOCATION_ID=9924650 (ACTIVE)
  
  OLD: SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_PINCODE=560001
  NEW: SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_PINCODE=110099
  ```

### **3. Pickup Address Details Updated**
- Updated API shipment creation to use correct active pickup location details:
  ```
  Location: "Home" (ID: 9924650)
  Address: "h-563 garm sahab road rohini sector-23"
  City: "Delhi"
  State: "Delhi" 
  Pincode: "110099"
  ```

### **4. Enhanced Logging Added**
- Added detailed logging to shipment creation API for easier debugging
- Logs now show order details, delivery address, and configuration status
