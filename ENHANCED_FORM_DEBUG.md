## üêõ **Debugging Steps**

### **Step 1: Check Console Logs**
When you try to create a product with the Enhanced Form (toggle ON):
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for these log messages:
   - `üöÄ Enhanced product form data being sent:` - Shows the data being prepared
   - `‚ûï Creating new product` - Confirms API call is being made
   - `‚úÖ Create result:` - Shows API response

### **Step 2: Check Network Tab**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "products" 
4. Try to create a product
5. Look for POST request to `/api/products`
6. Check the request payload and response

### **Step 3: Test Simple vs Enhanced Form**

#### **Simple Form Test (Should Work)**
1. Toggle Enhanced Form **OFF**
2. Fill required fields:
   - Name: "Test Product"
   - Brand: "Test Brand"
   - Category: Select any
   - Description: "Test description"
   - Price: 100
   - Stock: 10
   - Image: `https://via.placeholder.com/300`
3. Add ingredients if needed
4. Click Save

#### **Enhanced Form Test (Now Should Work)**
1. Toggle Enhanced Form **ON**
2. Fill **Basic** tab (required fields)
3. Optionally fill other tabs
4. Click Save

### **Step 4: Check Server Logs**
If running in development mode, check your terminal for:
- `üîç [POST] Raw request body:` - Shows what API received
- `üîç [POST] Validation result:` - Shows if validation passed
- `üéâ [POST] Creating new product with data:` - Confirms product creation
- `‚úÖ [POST] Product saved successfully with ID:` - Confirms success
