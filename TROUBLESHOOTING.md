# Troubleshooting Guide

## Product Creation Issues

### Problem: Cannot Add Products
If you're experiencing issues adding products, here are the solutions implemented:

### ✅ **Solution: Dual Form System**

We've implemented a **dual form system** with both simple and enhanced options:

1. **Simple Form** (Default): 
   - Contains only essential fields
   - Focuses on basic product information
   - Faster loading and easier to use
   - Perfect for quick product creation

2. **Enhanced Form** (Optional):
   - Contains comprehensive product attributes
   - Category-specific fields
   - Advanced features like variants, nutritional info, etc.
   - Best for detailed product management

### 🔄 **How to Switch Between Forms**

In the admin dashboard:
1. Click "Add Product" to open the product dialog
2. Look for the **"Enhanced Form"** toggle in the dialog header
3. **Toggle OFF** (default) = Simple Form
4. **Toggle ON** = Enhanced Form with all advanced features

### 📝 **Simple Form Fields**

The simple form includes only essential fields:
- ✅ Product Name * (required)
- ✅ Brand * (required) 
- ✅ Category * (required)
- ✅ Subcategory (optional)
- ✅ Description * (required)
- ✅ Price * (required)
- ✅ Original Price (optional)
- ✅ Stock Quantity * (required)

### 🚨 **Common Validation Issues**

Make sure to fill out all required fields (*):

- SEO optimization (meta titles, descriptions, keywords)
- Advanced attributes (weight, dimensions, certifications)
- Inventory management (min/max order quantities)

### 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still experiencing problems:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Ensure you have valid categories created
3. Try using the Simple Form first
4. Verify all required fields are filled
